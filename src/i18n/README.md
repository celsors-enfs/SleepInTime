# i18n Translation Guidelines

## Source of Truth

**Portuguese (pt-br) is the source of truth** for homepage content structure and meaning.

French (fr) and Spanish (es) translations must remain **structurally identical** to Portuguese:
- Same number of sections
- Same number of paragraphs per section
- Same heading hierarchy (H1/H2)
- Same number of feature bullets (4 items)
- Same disclaimer placement and wording (translated)

## Translation Requirements

- All translations must match PT content 1:1 in structure
- SEO keywords should be included naturally:
  - Include "sleep calculator" (or local translation) at least once
  - Include "bedtime" and "wake up time" (can be in parentheses) if natural
- Maintain medical conservatism: no medical claims, educational only
- Keep tone: clear, friendly, informative
